## Issues & Pull Requests

### ``` Reporting Bugs ```
Please try to report complete, well described, reproducible bugs to us. If you can't, that's ok. ```Do your best```.

- Our [Bug Report][issue-bug-report] template includes instructions on providing the information we need from you.

### ``` Requesting new features ```

You are invited to propose _complete, well described_ new features via...
- For a MAJOR NEW FEATURE, submit an OEP (openEBS Enhancement Proposal). Maintainers will review & discuss the new feature proposal and potentially schedule community discussions on it. The OEP process is new for us, so please bear with us on this.
- or submit a detailed ISSUE in the ``` community Cafe Repo ```
  - You must indicate if you are able to complete and support the features you propose.
- Note: Raising PR's as a <kbd>Feature Request</kbd> is not the process for requesting new features. Such PR's will be closed, and you will asked to resubmit as an OEP or an ISSUE.
   - All PR's are reviewed by the Maintainers and Eng/Dev first, before being approved and committed for Eng/development.


> The processes above are documented in the ```community Cafe repo``` discussion tab.
> If you canâ€™t find them, please reach out one of the Maintainers below. We're happy to help.

<BR>

## What is a _Special Interest Group (SIG)_?
- SIGs are small teams working together on a specific area/topic/zone.
- They may change at any time, and have no strict definition.
- SIGs may be created, empowered, and destroyed by the maintainers at any time.


## May I join a SIG?
- Of course, we'd love that!


## May I Become a maintainer?
- Yes, we have a set of guidelines and rules explaining how to advance to Maintainer-ship...
    - Governance rules, code of conduct, contributing and a ``` Maintainer Ladder ```  that details pre-reqs, criteria and responsibilities you need to agree to & meet
    - Contribution history is critical
    - PR review input, ISSUE management
    - Attendance at community meetings are also important
    - Feature contribution
    - Active support engagement on our SLACK Channel
    - Bug resolution
